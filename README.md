# Web API Weather Dashboard

## Webpage Functionality
* The user is presented with a webpage where they can search for the weather of the city they enter.
* After the user inputs a city, the user is presented with the current weather and the following 5-day forecast for the city they entered.
* The current weather section displays a picture icon of the current weather along with the temperature, wind speed, humidity, and uv index levels.
* UV index levels are color coded to match severity.
* The 5-day forecast section displays the date, weather picture icon, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
* When the user enters a city, a search history button is created and labeled with the city the user searched. When the buttons are clicked the user is shown the current and future weather for the city.
